# React Gallery

## Description

*Duration: Weekend Project (3-4 days)*

This React Gallery is a fullstack full CRUD app. I've chosen not to use a database with this project and focus on learning Material UI styling. So all of the photos are stored in the project and a database does not need to be set up. Users can see all of my favorite photos of my cats and also input their own! Then hit that heart to like the photo or choose to delete it.

___

1. Fork and clone.
2. Run the commands ```npm init --yes``` and ```npm install``` in your IDE terminal.
3. Start your server with ```npm run server``` and start your client with ```npm run client```.
4. If you want to add your own photos or remove mine, make sure you add/remove mine from the ```public/images``` file and update the ```server/modules/gallery.data.js``` file with the new paths.
5. Everything is good to go now! Don't forget to shut down your server and client when you're done!
